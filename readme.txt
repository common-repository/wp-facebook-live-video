WP Facebook Live Video displays a live video from your Facebook Page or Profile on any Wordpress post, page or widget area.

== Description ==

ATTENTION: RECENTLY MY FACEBOOK DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT WAS SUSPENDED WITHOUT WARNING OR REASON BY FACEBOOK. I HAVE FIRMLY PETITIONED AND PROTESTED AGAINST THIS ACTION BY FACEBOOK BECAUSE MY ONLY APP WITH THEM WHICH IS USED SOLEY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT OF THIS WORDPRESS PLUGIN HAS ONLY BEEN USED FOR PURPOSES THAT ARE IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH THE WORDPRESS AND FACEBOOK COMMUNITY. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY MALICE OR ILL-INTENT ON MY PART AND I AM SHOCKED AND VERY ANGRY BY FACEBOOK'S DECISION WHICH THEY HAVE GIVEN NO REASON FOR. 

BECAUSE OF THIS I CAN NO LONGER DEVELOP THIS PLUGIN ANY MORE OR PROVIDE SUPPORT BECAUSE I CAN NO LONGER TEST THE PLUGIN. EVERY PART OF ME WANTS TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS PLUGIN AND SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY BUT DUE TO FACEBOOK'S ACTIONS I CAN'T UNFORTUNATELY DO THIS. I WOULD ASK YOU TO WRITE TO THEM ABOUT THIS SO I CAN REGAIN ACCESS, BUT WHO ON EARTH WOULD YOU TALK TO? THE ORGANISATION HAS NO SOUL, IT'S NOT RAN BY REAL PEOPLE, THERE'S NOT ACTUALLY ANY REAL PEOPLE YOU CAN TALK TO - TRY AND FIND AN EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBER FOR THEM! WITH THAT SAID THE PLUGIN SHOULD STILL HOPEFULLY WORK BUT AS I SAID, DON'T EXPECT ANY SUPPORT OR UPDATES. 

WP Facebook Live Video is a free plugin which is used to display a live video feed from a Facebook page or user profile.

The plugin requires some initial setup work which involves creating a Facebook application. A step by step guide on the plugin settings page will show you through this including a video showing the full setup process. Once you have setup the application and you enter in your application details on the settings page you just need to place the shortcode: [facebooklivevideo] wherever you want the live video to appear. Or you can select the "Facebook Live Video" widget and place it in your sidebar. If there's no live video broadcasting nothing will display however in the plugin settings you can add custom content (text or images) when there's no video broadcasting.

You can also display previous live videos using the shortcode [facebookpastvideo] which will display a video listing of all previous live videos and you can limit the amount of past videos shown using the shortcode parameter: [facebookpastvideo videos=9] (which would display the 9 most recent live videos). 	

It will take a few minutes to setup however once it's done there's no need to change the code everytime you do a new video it will just work, all you need to do is press the live button on your device! 

Live comments from Facebook will also appear below the video and these can be turned off in the plugin settings.
